In this project, I leveraged my knowledge of objects and object constructors to create a small library app. The library has a button to add new books, which displays a form to fill out the book's details. Once the form is filled out, the book is displayed in the library.

The library allows the user to remove books from the library and toggle whether or not the book has been read with buttons.
